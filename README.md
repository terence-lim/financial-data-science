# FINANCIAL DATA SCIENCE


Designed to support financial data science workflows,
the [FinDS Python package](https://github.com/terence-lim/financial-data-science)
demonstrates how to use database engines
such as SQL, Redis, and MongoDB to manage and access large datasets, including:

- Core financial databases such as CRSP, Compustat, IBES, and TAQ

- Public economic data APIs from sources like FRED and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

- Structured and unstructured data from academic and research websites

Its companion [Financial Data Science Python Notebooks](https://terence-lim.github.io/docs/financial-data-science-notebooks/)
provides practical examples and templates for applying:

- Financial econometrics and time series modeling

- Graph analytics, event studies, and backtesting strategies

- Machine learning for predictive analytics

- Natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights from financial text

- Neural networks and large language models (LLMs) for advanced decision-making
