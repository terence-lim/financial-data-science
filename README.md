# FINANCIAL DATA SCIENCE


__FinDS__ Python package for [financial data science projects](https://terence-lim.github.io/finds-notebooks/)

- use database engines SQL, MongoDB, Redis
- interfaces for
  - structured data from CRSP, Compustat, IBES, TAQ
  - APIs from ALFRED, BEA
  - unstructured data from SEC Edgar, Federal Reserve websites
  - academic websites by Ken French, Loughran and MacDonald, Hoberg and Phillips
- recipes for econometrics, finance, graphs, event studies, backtesting
- applications of statistics, machine learning, neural networks and large language models
